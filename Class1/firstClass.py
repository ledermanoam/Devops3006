## Create a program with the following:

#A.
#1. Create a variable name first with value 7.
#2. Create a variable name second with value 44.3.
#3. Print result of adding first to second.
#4. Print result of multiplying first by second
#5. Print result of dividing second by first

#1
first = 7
second = 44.3
print(first + second)
print(first*second)
print(second/first)

#B
a = 9
b = 8
c = 15

# convert int to string to print
my_number = 5 + 5
print("result is:" + str(my_number))

#D
x = 5
y = 2.36
print(x+int(y))

a = 8
b = "123"
print(str(a)+b)
